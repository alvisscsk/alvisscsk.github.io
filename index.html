		<h2>5 Creative ways to decorate with polaroids</h2>

		<p>Thanks to Instagram and Facebook, we take more photos of ourselves, our family and our everyday moments than ever before. But, how many of us actually make the effort to print out our memories?
		<br>
		It seems like printing photographs is a thing of the past – and once digitally shared, those special moments live on only in our camera roles and social media feeds. What a pity – as photos are the easiest way to bring love, inspiration and a personal touch into our homes.
		<br>
		A beautifully decorated house aside, there’s nothing better than walking into a space and feeling that ‘personal touch’ – one that instantly gives you a feel for who a person is and what they love. When I walk into a house, the first thing I look for are the photographs – not the fancy, photo shoot kind, but the real snaps that give me a glimpse into the hearts of the people who live there.
		<br>
		With 	the rise of all things Instagram-inspired, printing polaroids is a trendy way to display photographs and add personality to home décor.</p>
		<h2>Here are five creative ways to decorate your home using polaroids</h2>

		<h3>1. Jazz up the traditional gallery wall</h3>
			<p class="c">Instead of uploading your holiday photographs to your Facebook wall, hang them on your living room wall – and relive those priceless memories!</p>
